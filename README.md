# OpenPLZ API Delphi Client

The official [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) client library for direct access to the [OpenPLZ API](https://www.openplzapi.org/en).

+ Supports Delphi 12 Athens and Delphi 11 Alexandria
+ Supports all available [API endpoints](https://openplzapi.org/swagger/index.html)
+ Supports paged responses and [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) error responses
+ Supports VCL, FireMonkey (FMX) and non-visual applications
+ Network communication based on System.Net.HttpClient

## Installation

As Delphi does not have an established package manager, you have the following options:

+ Include this repository as [submodule](https://github.blog/open-source/git/working-with-submodules/) in the Git repository of your project. 

+ Keep this repository separate and add the `src` folder as a search path to your project options.

+ Copy the source code from the `src` folder into the Git repository of your project and work with a copy of the code.

## Getting started

Documentation is available in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/openpotato/openplzapi-client.delphi/wiki).

## Can I help?

Yes, that would be much appreciated. The best way to help is to post a response via the Issue Tracker and/or submit a Pull Request.
